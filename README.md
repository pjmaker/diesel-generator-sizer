# Diesel Generator Sizer

The sizing of diesel generators in hybrid power systems
is critical to their performance. This project contains 
a simple model implemented in Haskell that determines the
optimal sizing of generators. It might be of interest in 
order to:

* Size new plant
* Check that your current methods are correct
* Finally as a small haskell example

## Current state

Initial setup, the author is off playing on other
things and hopes to get this up shortly. Feel
free to email if your interested in thetopic though.
I'll have a play this weekend.

## TODO

1. Improve the diesel model.
1. Add in hybrid power components.
