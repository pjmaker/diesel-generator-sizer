# Diesel Generator Sizer

The sizing of diesel generators in hybrid power systems
is critical to their performance. This project contains 
a simple model implemented in Haskell that determines the
optimal sizing of generators. It might be of interest in 
order to:

* Size new plant
* Check that your current methods are correct
* Finally as a small haskell example

## TODO

1. Improve the diesel model.
1. Add in hybrid power components.
